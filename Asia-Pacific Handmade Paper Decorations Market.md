These decorations are used in various forms, such as wall hangings, table centerpieces, and seasonal decorations, contributing to a personalized aesthetic for home interiors. The growing trend of environmental consciousness and the desire for handmade, locally produced goods have encouraged homeowners to embrace these items. Additionally, the rise of DIY culture, where consumers prefer creating their own decorative items, has further boosted the demand for handmade paper decorations in homes across the region.In contrast, the commercial segment focuses on the use of handmade paper decorations for businesses and public spaces. This includes applications in hotels, restaurants, offices, and event venues where businesses seek to differentiate themselves with unique and eco-friendly décor options.
